### Hi! i am Victoria Mortensen 👋

I’m Victoria, a happy Product Manager with an engineering background from Philly+NYC, who makes SaaS products that are intuitive, accessible, beautiful, and fun to use. I love the intersection between super detailed and highly technical requirements (including hardware) and making mocks in Figma, all the while focusing on driving proper business outcomes. Applying my entrepreneurial startup genes as best as I can along the way! :)

Fun fact: When not on my laptop, I find great joy in painting; anything from portraits to landscapes!
