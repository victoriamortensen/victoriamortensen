### Hi! i am Victoria Mortensen ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Victoria, a happy Software Engineer from Philly, who makes web products that are intuitive, accessible, beautiful, and fun to use. I love the intersection between pushing super detailed CSS or a nifty React Component to production and making Figma drafts for the product team and me to discuss new feature development.
