### Hi! i am Victoria Mortensen 👋

I’m Victoria, a happy Software Engineer from Philly, who makes web products that are intuitive, accessible, beautiful, and fun to use. I love the intersection between pushing super detailed CSS or a nifty React Component to production and making Figma drafts for the product team and me to discuss new feature development.

Fun fact: When not on my laptop, I find great joy in painting; anything from portraits to landscapes!
