### Hi! i am Victoria Mortensen 👋

I’m Victoria, a happy Product Manager / Engineer from Philly, who makes web products that are intuitive, accessible, beautiful, and fun to use. I love the intersection between pushing super detailed CSS on a nifty React Component to production AND making Figma drafts as a Product Manager to drive business outcomes. Applying my entrepreneurial startup genes as best as I can along the way
